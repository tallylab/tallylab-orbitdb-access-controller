> TallyLab's OrbitDB plugins for Identity and Access Management

Building distributed applications (dapps) without a centralized blockchain presents
significant difficulties with regard to keypair management: Storage, recovery, etc. Keypair
management, ulitimately, is a UX problem - a tradeoff between security and user convenience.

Other approaches are effective but do not make it easy on the users:
- Exporting and importing highly randomized keys
- Deterministic keys based on a strong password or passphrase

Both of the above approaches rely on one or both of the following:
- The user's own diligence in terms of saving their keys and recovering them, often utilizing
a third party service such as Keybase or a password manager that supports keypairs.
- The user's memory, having to recall a password or passphrase. Often times these are forgotten
or simply required to be stored in the same place as the keypair itself.

To mitigate these issues, TallyLab opted to use a variant of the second approach, using a
32 byte seed to generate keys via the nacl encryption library. However, in TL, the seed is
generated from highly personal, memory-based questions, similar to security questions.
Each question, while seemingly knowable, combines with the others to produce a set of
questions that would be very difficult for anybody else besides the primary user to know.

The answers are them summed together to create the 32 byte seed, and then passed into the
TallyLab Identity Provider to allow the user to "authenticate via memory" in a reliable way.

This package does **not** contain the aforementioned questions and instead handles everything
post-generation of the seed. Mainly, the two primary classes, TallyLabAccessController and
TallyLabIdentityProvider act as glue between TallyLab and the underlying OrbitDB infrastructure.

## Install

The primary focus for this package is browser usage. To generate the browser libraries:

```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/tallylab/tallylab-orbitdb-iam
$ make build
```

The final files will then be available in the `dist/` folder:

- `tallylab-orbitdb-iam.min.js` (minified)
- `tallylab-orbitdb-iam.min.js.map` (Source map for development purposes)

## Usage

This package exposes four items:
1. TallyLabIdentityProvider
2. TallyLabAccessProvider
3. Identities (helper class from OrbitDB not normally exposed)
4. AccessControllers (ditto the above)

It is used in TallyLab similarly to the following:

```
const TallyLabIAM = require('tallylab-orbitdb-iam')

const iam = TallyLabIAM.initialize()
```

## Background

For a detailed explanation of how the system comes together to produce deterministic
keypairs, please see this document:
[Towards Deterministic OrbitDB Addresses](../examples/tutorials/Determinisitc_Addresses.md).

## Security

In order to test functionality, the automated tests intentionally expose the private signing
and encryption keys for the following seeds. Thus, these should be considered fully
compromised and should never be used for any users, ever.
